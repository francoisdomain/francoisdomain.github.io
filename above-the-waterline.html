                <p data-translate="waterline_desc" >Eddie’s life has been defined by inertia—a slow slide into a kind of numbness he barely notices until it’s almost too late. Then comes the bombshell: Mathilda, his wife of twenty years, announces she wants a divorce. Thrown into a spiral of regret and disbelief, Eddie flees to a sun-soaked island in the Aegean, hoping to escape the memories that haunt him. But distance doesn’t bring the clarity or relief he expected. Instead, it pulls him deeper into the pain of what he’s lost, forcing him to confront the one person he’s been avoiding for years: himself.</p>

              <p>So, this is how it ends.  </p><br><p>
              A quick chat at the corner of the kitchen table, wedged between the main and dessert, like we were just discussing Aunt Adelaide’s cataract surgery. Only this time, it was my guts getting sliced open.  </p><p>
              At least you spared me the old “It’s not you, it’s me” cliché. That’s not your style. You’re more the type to say it’s always my fault. On principle. If you could, you’d probably pin Aunt Adelaide’s cataracts on me, too.  </p><p>
              We made it past seven years—everyone told us that was the tough one.  </p><p>
              We made it past ten—everyone told us that was the tough one.  </p><p>
              We made it past fifteen, and by then, no one said anything because they’d all been divorced for years. </p><p>
              We almost made it to twenty. Funny thing is, we still might. Divorce doesn’t happen overnight. It takes time. Can you imagine? Us signing the papers on our twentieth anniversary. “Happy anniversary, Mathilda. So, which table are you keeping—the living room one or the dining set?”  </p><p></p><p>
              </p><p>
              I had a good run, didn’t I? All those efforts to keep my head low, tighten my belt—hell, it shows I’ve got willpower, like I needed any more proof. But what’s the point, when you’ve been living my midlife crisis behind my back, pedal to the metal? Straight into a concrete pillar on Storrow Drive. And I’m stuck in the passenger seat, watching it all go down.</p><p>
              So I sat there, fists clenched under the table, listening to you say it was “for the best,” that we “had good times,” but somehow “lost each other along the way”—and you didn’t even have the decency to look me in the eye. All I could think was how stupid I was for not driving that intern from accounting all the way home.</p><p>
              The clock on the wall coughs up seconds, one by one. Too loud, but not loud enough to drown out your words.  </p><p>
              — You’re not saying anything…</p><p>
              What do you expect me to say, Mathilda? What do you possibly expect me to say? That we can fix this? That we just need to try harder, see a therapist, or take up couples’ yoga? I know you too well. Once you’ve made up your mind—even on the dumbest of ideas—there’s no turning back. You used to go on sex strikes to get your way. Lately, you’ve just resorted to monosyllabic answers and long silences. How long has it been since we last touched each other? Five months? Six?  </p><p>
              I used to keep track, back in winter.  </p><p>
              Sure, not everything revolves around sex, but when it stops altogether—what’s left?  </p><p>
              And I can’t even blame you, not really. It’s partly my fault. No—it’s entirely my fault. After years of being the one to initiate, I got tired of begging for your attention. Once a week, every Sunday, like some pathetic ritual. So, I decided to strike back. Not because I didn’t want you—God, I wanted you—but because I wanted you to want me. I thought I’d give you time, let the desire build up.  </p><p>
              And then, of course, Netflix became more engaging than I ever could. “Take your time,” I’d say. “Finish your show.” And you took it literally. If I went to bed early, you’d slip in later. And later. Until I eventually just turned off the light. I gave up in my own way, too. Stopped being hurt when I woke up alone. Stopped caring when breakfast was just silence and coffee.  </p><p>
              So, I’ll take the blame. There’s no sense keeping score now.  </p><p>

            <p>— Are you okay, Edward? </p><p>
            I gripped the edge of the table like a lifeline, swallowing down words I’d never say. Since when did I become Edward to you? I’ve been Eddie since the day we met. I tried to remember when that changed. Like everything else, I guess it just slipped away.  </p><p>
            — I’m fine. I… I’m fine.  </p><p>
            I barely recognized my own voice. Maybe it was Edward’s voice. Not Eddie’s.  </p><p>
            You were already halfway down a list of practicalities I hadn’t even thought about—the joint account, who’d keep the cat (you hate the cat anyway), moving into Arnold’s room until we sorted out what to do with the house.  </p><p>
            — Wait… What?</p><p>
            You stiffened, pinching your lips. </p><p> 
            — Yes, Edward. We’ll have to talk about the house. You know how involved I am in the community. You’re always holed up in your office—what difference does it make to you if you’re here or somewhere else?</p><p>
            I almost laughed. “Involved in the community.” Unreal. If throwing Tupperware parties twice a month qualifies as community service, I should be glad you never took on climate change or world peace.  </p><p>
            Looking back, I want to believe you were just clinging to logistics to keep from falling apart emotionally. If so, you were doing a damn good job of it, way better than me.  </p><p>
            You wanted the car. For the kids. The eldest already has one, and the youngest—he’s eighteen now, when did that happen?—is across the country, living it up. What does he care about the car? You wanted everything and nothing at once. Played your cards like a master magician, flipping hearts into spades so fast I couldn’t keep up. All I could do was sit there, breathless, groping for answers to questions I hadn’t even grasped.  </p>

          <p>Under the table, my left leg started bouncing. First softly, then harder. It’s my pressure valve. Always has been. I tried to hold it down with my elbow, but it was no use. After two decades, you should’ve known that. You could’ve let me change into my running gear. Running’s the only thing that calms me down. You know that. But in Mathilda’s world, there’s only Mathilda.  </p><p>
          — You should see someone, you said. I mean, physically. Emotionally.</p><p>
          Like ordering a pizza. With any luck, DoorDash would drop off the love of my life at my door, still warm.  </p><p>
          — I’m not there yet, Mathilda.</p><p>
          You didn’t reply.  </p><p>
          </p><p>
          Of course, we should cancel dinner at Mike and Mary-Ann’s. I couldn’t bear another night pretending everything was fine. Or worse, having Mary-Ann play therapist because she read something in Good Housekeeping.  </p><p>
          Cynical? No, I’m not cynical. I’m just about to implode. My leg’s doing a tap dance under the table, and my nails are carving trenches into my thighs. What do you say, Mathilda? Should we take a break?  </p><p>
          — Speak, Edward. Say something.</p><p>
          Believe me, it’s better if I don’t. Because what I’ve got on the tip of my tongue is everything you never wanted to hear. Not today, not ever. But especially not today.  </p><p>
          You gave me that condescending glare of yours. You should’ve been a teacher—the kind kids hate.  </p><p>
          — I’m going for a run.</p><p>
          You mumbled something, but I didn’t bother asking what. I went upstairs to change, almost calm, almost peaceful.  </p><p>
          </p><p>
          It’s hot today.  </p><p>
          There’s a breeze, but it’s hot.</p><p>
